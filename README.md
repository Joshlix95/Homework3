You'll be implementing the game Snake. I've started it and given you an outline of how it might work.

Feel free to add or remove things as you see fit. Look for the comments marked TODO, those are all things

that you should implement. These include but are not limited to:

Updating the score and displaying it on the screen
Implementing the move method for the snake
Implementing the checkForFood, collision, and out of bounds methods of the Model
Adding the code to the Controller, to respond to arrow key presses.
Also, I've given ideas for possible extra credit opportunities. Don't feel pressured to do any of these.
